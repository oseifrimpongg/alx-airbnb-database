# AirBnB Clone Project Database ERD

## üìå Project Overview

This project models a **Property Booking System** database using an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**. It outlines the core entities involved in an Airbnb-like application where users can book properties, make payments, leave reviews, and message other users.

The ERD was designed following normalization principles to ensure data integrity, scalability, and maintainability.

## üß± Design Principles

-  **UUIDs** used as primary keys for global uniqueness
-  **Foreign Keys** enforce relational integrity
-  **Normalized** to 3NF ‚Äì no redundant or repeating groups
-  **Enumerated types** (e.g. role, payment method) used for controlled values
-  Indexed on frequently queried columns (user_id, property_id, booking_id)
